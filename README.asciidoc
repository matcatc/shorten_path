== Introduction

`Shorten Path` is a small utility I wrote for use in my tmux configuration to display a path to file in a succinct way.
It takes inspiration from how vim shows filenames in tabs.
Here is an example:

.Example
----------------------
$ shorten_path ./a/path/to/some/file.txt
./a/p/t/s/file.txt
----------------------

So it strips out characters for intermediate directories in the path leaving only the first character.
The idea being that when working with a set of files one typically can identify the file knowing just this information.
